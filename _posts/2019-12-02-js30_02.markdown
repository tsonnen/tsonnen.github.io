# Overview

This lesson was a little bit more in depth on the CSS and HTML. This was a nice change as it also covered changing an items style using JavaScript.

# Challenges

This was a very straight forward lesson/challenge. I didn't find any part of it super challenging.

# Additions

* Changed the color of the second hand to be red
