# Overview

This lesson was super interesting. The look ahead feature is pretty much a standard in modern web development. It was very cool learning how to implement this without any framework.

# Challenges

I didn't really run into any large challenges while working on this. There does seem to be a slight issue with FireFox and this lesson that I do want to look into though.

# Additions

None. I felt that I learned a substantial amount from the content in the lesson.
