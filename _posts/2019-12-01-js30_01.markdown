# Overview

So far, I am enjoying this lesson set. It's very nice that all of the HTML and CSS is provided so that I can just focus on the actual Javascript, rather than formatting issues.

This lesson itself is very interesting and super fun to implement.

# Challenges

There weren't any large challenges that I faced. Really the only issue that I ran into was just getting back into JavaScript. It's been ~4 years since I last wrote pure JavaScript, so there was a little bit of rust. 

# Additions

* The ability to play a sound by clicking on a "key"
    * Allows for mobile users to play around
