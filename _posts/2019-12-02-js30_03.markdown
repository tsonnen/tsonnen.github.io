# Overview

This lesson was very interesting. I enjoyed learning about using CSS variables and the ability to manipulate them using JavaScript. I think that this challenge lays some very good ground work for future expansions.

# Challenges

This was a very straight forward lesson/challenge. I didn't find any part of it super challenging.

# Additions
