You can see a live demo [here](https://tsonnen.github.io/JavaScript30/Day04/index.html)!

# Overview

This lesson is very heavy on the nitty gritty of JavaScript array functions rather than working to create an actual end product. This is a litle nice, but I personally like to create something and have it to show off.

# Challenges

Most of the operations are fairly similar to the array operations availible in other programming languages. This makes it so that I did not experience any challenges

# Additions

None. Since there was not an end goal, I did not see any major improvements. It might be nice to re-visit this project and experiment more with array operations, but it seems like there is another lesson for array operations.
