![Bad Flutter Code]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/img/2019-06-12-Header.png %})

I recently posted my first mobile application on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tsonnen.initiativetracker). 

This is a relatively simple application, I have posted a write-up that can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/initiative_tracker.md %}).

To make this application, I used the still relatively fresh and new
cross-platform framework [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
