# Overview

This lesson is more experience in manipulating objects using CSS. My intial goal was not to learn CSS/HTML5, but it is really interesting just how much can be achieved through their usage.

# Challenges

I didn't really run into any large challenges while working on this.

# Additions

None. I felt that I learned a substantial amount from the content in the lesson.
