I am currently a Software Test Engineer at Chief Architect Software. I work on tests for UI automation as well as manually testing and verifying defects. 

I graduated from University of Idaho with a Bachelors of Computer Science in 2018. While I attended college, I was involved in a few research projects. The first was using semantic web to analyze the universities Vivo. The second was using bioinformatics to find genes that were expressed when an plant is infected by a certain parasite.
